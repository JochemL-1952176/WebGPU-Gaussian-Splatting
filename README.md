## WebGPU Gaussian Splatting
This repository implements the [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) rasterizer as a standard render pipeline for use in the browser.

Aside from this, different Order-Independent Transparency techniques such as screen-door transparency and [Weighted Blended OIT](https://jcgt.org/published/0002/02/09/) have been implemented in order to test their efficacy in this application.
